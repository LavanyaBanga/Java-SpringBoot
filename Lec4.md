## Java 8 – Stream API  

---

## 1. Introduction  

In the previous phase, we learned about Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces.  

In this phase, we move to **Stream API**, one of the most powerful features introduced in Java 8.

Stream API allows processing collections of data in a functional style.  
It simplifies filtering, transforming, and aggregating data.

---

## 2. What is Stream API?  

Stream API is used to process collections of objects in a declarative way.

It does NOT store data.  
It processes data from a source such as:

- List  
- Set  
- Map  
- Arrays  

Streams allow operations like:

- Filtering  
- Sorting  
- Mapping  
- Counting  
- Collecting  

---

## 3. Why Stream API is Important  

Before Java 8, processing collections required loops.

Example (Before Java 8):

```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
for(Integer num : list) {
    if(num % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.println(num);
    }
}
```

With Stream API:

```java
list.stream()
    .filter(num -> num % 2 == 0)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

Stream API:
- Reduces boilerplate code  
- Improves readability  
- Supports functional programming  
- Supports parallel processing

## 4. Creating Streams  

### From Collection

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Amit", "Neha", "Raj");
Stream<String> stream = names.stream();
```

### From Array

```java
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4};
IntStream stream = Arrays.stream(arr);
```

---

## 5. Types of Stream Operations  

Stream operations are divided into:

1. Intermediate Operations  
2. Terminal Operations  

---

## 6. Intermediate Operations  

Intermediate operations return a new stream.

Examples:

- filter()  
- map()  
- sorted()  
- distinct()  
- limit()  

### Example – filter()

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6);

numbers.stream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .forEach(System.out::println);
```

---

### Example – map()

map() transforms elements.

```java
numbers.stream()
       .map(n -> n * n)
       .forEach(System.out::println);
```

---

## 7. Terminal Operations  

Terminal operations produce a result or side effect.

Examples:

- forEach()  
- collect()  
- count()  
- reduce()  

---

### Example – collect()

```java
List<Integer> evenList = numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

---

### Example – count()

```java
long count = numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n > 3)
        .count();
```

---

### Example – reduce()

```java
int sum = numbers.stream()
        .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
```

---

## 8. Method Reference  

Method reference is a shorter way to write lambda expressions.

Instead of:

```java
numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));
```

We can write:

```java
numbers.forEach(System.out::println);
```

---

## 9. Parallel Stream  

Streams can run in parallel for better performance.

```java
numbers.parallelStream()
       .forEach(System.out::println);
```

Parallel streams divide tasks among multiple threads.

## 10. Viva Questions (Detailed Answers)

### 1. What is Stream API?  
Stream API is a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows processing of collections in a functional style using operations like filter, map, and reduce.

### 2. Difference between intermediate and terminal operations?  
Intermediate operations return a stream and are lazy. Terminal operations produce a result or side effect.

### 3. What is lazy evaluation?  
Intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is called.

### 4. What is reduce()?  
reduce() combines elements of a stream into a single result, such as sum or multiplication.

### 5. What is parallel stream?  
Parallel stream processes elements using multiple threads to improve performance.

## 12. Interview Questions (Detailed Answers)

### 1. Difference between Collection and Stream?  
Collection stores data, while Stream processes data. Stream does not store elements.

### 2. What is lazy evaluation in Stream API?  
Intermediate operations are executed only when a terminal operation is invoked.

### 3. When should parallel streams be used?  
When dealing with large datasets where operations are independent and can be processed concurrently.

### 4. What is the benefit of Stream API over loops?  
Stream API provides cleaner, more readable code and supports functional-style programming.
